# Posting-Reading
This is a React project where user can  login, edit, delete, search, create and can save his blogs into a JSON server by using concepts of REST like patch, get, delete and post. Also basic concepts of react-redux, form-redux, state and hooks are also used in this project.

# How to run
First put the db.json file in seprate folder for the documentation you can refer to (https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server) and then run it on any port. Then create your react app and install suitable npm packages like redux, redux-thunk, axios and react-router-dom then run it(make sure to not run it on same port of json-server). If by chance it shows error of load undefined (which it rarely does) then please reload once or twice and then you can easily post and read.
